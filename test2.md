Lexi is a **GitHub action** which reports a readability score for Markdown files in your pull requests, allowing you to quantify and track documentation improvements.

This playground is a place to experiment with Lexi and see how it works.

The playground is divided into two sections: the editor and the results.

Write or paste text into the editor to see the results of the readability analysis.

The results section shows the results of the readability analysis of the text in the editor. The results update automatically as you type.

Lexi calculates a readability score to estimate the complexity and ease of reading for your documentation files. The score can be used as a guide to help you understand how changes may impact the readability of your documentation.

The score is a scaled combination of several readability tests.
